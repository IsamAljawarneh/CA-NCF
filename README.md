# CA-NCF

CA-NCF is a an algorithm that is a hybridization between a prefiltering context incorporation approach known as [itemSplitting](http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/item-splitting-umuai-2013.pdf) and a NN Collaborative Filtering method for recommendations known as Neural Collaborative Filtering [NCF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031).

to run this example you need to do the following:

* **install** [AnalyticsZoo](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/0.2.0/#PythonUserGuide/install/) BigDL
* **Run** with [jupyter](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/0.2.0/#PythonUserGuide/run/#run-with-jupyter-notebook)
* **make** a folder in the root directory once you login to jupyter then create a new folder `datasets` then an inner folder for the corresponding example. for example `tripAdvisor` and upload the corresponding dataset to it.
